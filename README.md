# Machine-Learning-Stanford-University
Learnt to apply the most advanced machine learning algorithms to problems such as anti-spam, image recognition, clustering, building recommender systems, and many other problems. I am also learning how to select the right algorithm for the right job, as well as becoming expert at 'debugging' and figuring out how to improve a learning algorithm's performance
